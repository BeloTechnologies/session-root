#session-root

This was originally developed as a core microservice for handling all root API calls within the Sessions application. However, as the architecture shifted to a monolithic API, maintaining a separate service became unnecessary. It has since been archived to document its original purpose and functionality.

This has been converted into a public archive to provide insight into the work that was being done.
